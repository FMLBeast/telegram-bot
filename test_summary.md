## 🛠️ Test Infrastructure Quality

### Strengths ✅
- **Comprehensive Test Structure**: Unit, Integration, and E2E tests
- **Good Mocking Framework**: Proper AsyncMock usage
- **Database Testing**: In-memory SQLite for isolation
- **Coverage Reporting**: HTML and XML coverage reports
- **CI/CD Ready**: GitHub Actions workflow configured

### Areas for Improvement ⚠️
- **Mock Configuration**: Some services need better mock setup
- **Test Isolation**: Cross-test data contamination issues
- **Error Scenarios**: Need more error condition testing
- **Integration Testing**: Handler-service integration needs work

## 📈 Improvement Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Impact)
